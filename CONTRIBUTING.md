## Creating a New Skill

Skills should follow this structure:

### 1. Design Document (Optional)

Create `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md` with:
- Overview and purpose
- Decision criteria or workflow
- Implementation details
- Examples

### 2. Skill File (Required)

Create `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` with:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of when to use this skill
---

# Skill Name

## Overview

What this skill does and its core principle.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Condition 1
- Condition 2

## Process

Step-by-step instructions...
```

Required elements:
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Overview and core principles
- When to use the skill
- Step-by-step process

Optional elements:
- Key principles table
- Anti-patterns
- Examples

### 3. Update Marketplace (Required)

Add the new skill to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-skill-name",
  "source": "./skills/your-skill-name",
  "description": "Same description as in SKILL.md frontmatter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/britt/claude-code-skills",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "category": "workflow|productivity|documentation",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

## Building Skill Archives

To create zip archives of all skills for distribution:

```bash
./package.sh
```

This creates a `dist/` directory containing zip files for each skill (e.g., `dist/summoning-the-user.zip`).

## Testing Skills

Before submitting:
1. Install the skill locally
2. Test with Claude Code or Claude.ai
3. Verify the skill triggers correctly based on its description
4. Check that all instructions are clear and actionable

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. One skill per PR (unless they're closely related)
2. Include a brief description of what the skill does
3. Explain how you tested it
4. Update the README if adding a new skill
